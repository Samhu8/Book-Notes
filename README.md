This app is to take note of the books read and making notes about the book.

I used node.js and Express.js along with axios to pull the API in order to get the book cover image.

#How to work:

Install Node modules - npm i

#Start up app:

nodemon index.js

#Open in webpage:

Use http://localhost:3000/
